					<li>Should I choose LingsCars?</li>
				
			</h2>
			<p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li>With our deals, you get a brand new car with zero miles on the clock, 
			delivered to your door. The new car is fully taxed and has the full manufacturer's warranty and AA cover. 
			You then run this new car for 12, 18, 24, or 36 months depending on the term, and run it within an agreed 
			mileage limit (usually 10,000, 15,000, or 20,000 miles per year). LingsCars get car deals from many sources, 
			main dealers, and finance companies, or we work them out ourselves using different finance companies.</li></ul></p>

					<li>What should I know about car leasing?</li>
				</ol>
			</h2>
			<p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li>Car and Vehicle leasing is the leasing of the use of a car for a fixed 
			period of time. It is a cost-effective alternative to car or vehicle purchases. It can be known as PCP or 
			contract hire. The key difference in a car lease is that after the lease expires, the customer can return 
			the car or vehicle to the dealer for no cost, or can often buy it at an agreed price. Ling owns the UK’s 
			craziest car leasing company.</li></ul></p>
			
			
			<hr>
			
			<h2>
				<ol start="3">
					<li>What is a car leasing agreement consist of?</li>
				</ol>
			</h2>
			<p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li>Car leasing agreements typically stipulate an early termination fee 
			and limit the number of miles a customer can drive (for passenger cars, a common mileage is 10,000 to 
			15,000 miles per year of the car lease). If the mileage allowance is exceeded, a per-mile fee is charged. 
			Customers can negotiate a higher mileage allowance, for a higher lease payment.<br><br><li>Car lease agreements usually 
			specify how much wear and tear on the vehicle is allowable, and the customer may face a fee if the car is not 
			in good condition at the end of the lease. At the end of a leasing term, the customer must either return the 
			car or vehicle to the car leasing company or purchase it. The end of lease price is usually agreed upon when 
			the lease is signed but may be affected by car condition and mileage</li></li></ul></p>

			<h2>
				<ol start="4">
					<li>What are the steps to contract hiring a car from LingsCars?</li>
				</ol>
			</h2>
			<p>
				<ol type="A" start="1"><li>Choose your car.</li></ol>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>We recommend that you choose from the website's 
					list of cheapest deals, as this contains our best value, most readily available models. The primary difference between 
					business and personal contract hire is just the VAT exclusion/inclusion in the price.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br>
				
				<ol type="A" start="2"><li>Fill in an online proposal.</li></ol>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>You can fill in the online proposal form on the cars list booking page.</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<br>
				
				<ol type="A" start="3"><li>Send the proposal form to us.</li></ol>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>When you have made sure you have completed ALL the information on the proposal form, press the submit button on 
					the online form, or scan and email it. We may require from business customers a copy of your latest accounts or P and L and 
					balance sheet for the benefit of the finance company (We will advise you of this, it depends on a number of factors such as 
					credit scoring, number of years trading, etc). For private customers, we probably need a recent gas/water/electric bill, or 
					bank statement to prove the address, to prevent identity fraud. You will always need a copy of your full UK Driving Licence, 
					or passport.</li>
					
					<br>
					
					<li>In order that they may assess your suitability for credit, finance providers and some other service providers will make a 
					search with a credit reference agency and this will leave a footprint on your credit file. If you are a company or partnership, 
					they will also make enquiries about the director(s) or partners with a credit reference agency. Some funders and service providers 
					may carry out searches periodically after the inception of an agreement if they supply a credit line.</li>
					
				</ul>
				
				<br>
				
				<ol type="A" start="4"><li>Wait for an order form, then sign it – at this page, you will commit to the car.</li></ol>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>When finance approval has been completed, we will email you an order form for your car. A signed order form commits you to 
					order the car. Check it, print it, sign it, indicate your color choice, then scan/email it back to us. We then confirm and order 
					the car and confirm the lead time.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br>
				
				<ol type="A" start="5"><li>Sign finance documents and wait for delivery of your car.</li></ol>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>Usually, we will post (for security reasons) documents to be signed before the delivery of your car. These need to be completed 
					and returned, swiftly, usually together with the initial payment. Occasionally, LingsCars will arrange delivery of your car with 
					finance documents to be signed at the same time, but this is not typical. More proofs may be required. All this is to protect your 
					identity. Delivery is free, usually to your home or work address, whichever is most convenient.</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<br>
				
				<ol type="A" start="6"><li>Enjoy your car!</li></ol>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>You need to insure your car, but anyone you choose can drive it. Treat it as you would treat your own personal car. You have a 
					full UK manufacturer's warranty and whatever breakdown covers the manufacturer applies. 
					Usually, servicing is your own responsibility.</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<br>
				
				<ol type="A" start="7"><li>Prepare for, then return your car at the end of the contract.</li></ol>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>Simply, your car needs to be in a condition commensurate with its age and mileage. A useful guide is available in PDF format 
					to read/print <a href="https://www.lingscars.com/returnadvice.pdf">here</a>. It is collected directly from you at your address.</li>
